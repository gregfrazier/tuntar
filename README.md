# tuntar - tiny untar
Really simple 70 lines of code to unsafely extract a TAR file.

This is crap, lol. You can easily get screwed if you extract a tarbombed file. Overwrites without asking.

Very little error checking, wrote this because I needed an untar program on a computer where I had no permission to download/install software but let me compile and execute compiled programs.

ANSI C compliant for the most part. Compiles with TCC, GCC, Visual Studio, probably any modern compiler.
